# Down
An Android Application written in Java. for Event based invitations

Allows users to invite others to events by username, and store the information online.

This isn't an overly complex project and was done as a group of four, where we were learning Android Development process. When I re read it, I see a lot of inefficient code that has been written into these docs, but I'll leave it as it was when it was turned in for now.

This project was dropped when Google announced an app called "Who's Down?" that did a lot of the same things as this, 5 weeks into the development of this one.
