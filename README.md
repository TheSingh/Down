# Down
An Android Application written in Java. for Event based invitations

Allows users to invite others to events by username, and store the information online.

This isn't an overly complex project and was done as a group of four, where we were learning Android Development process. When I re read it, I see a lot of inefficient code that has been written into these docs, but I'll leave it as it was when it was turned in for now.

It was a tall task at the time considering it was our first take at android development but looking back, a lot could've been improved on, and this could've been done so much faster.

This project was dropped when Google announced an app called "Who's Down?" that did a lot of the same things as this, 5 weeks into the development of this one.


Current Features implemented:

     - Working GUI for each task.
     - Create an event, and save it on the cloud server.
     - Invite other users to that event.
     - Fetch the list of events you've created from the server and display them.
     - Fetch the list of events you've been invited to and display them in order of invitation.
     - Display events and who's been invited to each event.
     - Get notifications for events you've been invited to.
     - Accept/Decline events you've been invited to.
